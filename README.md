# CNN-Interpretable-Deep-Learning-CAM
An Explainable AI project demonstrating Class Activation Maps (CAM) for CNNs using TensorFlow and Keras. The project accesses intermediate convolutional layers and weights to visualize class-specific regions, improving interpretability of image classification decisions through global average pooling–based explainability.
